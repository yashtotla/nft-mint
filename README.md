### Step 1: Setup Local Tooling
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin

1. Hardhat compiles your smart contract from solidity to bytecode.
2. Hardhat will spin up a "local blockchain" on your computer. It's like a mini, test version of Ethereum running on your computer to help you quickly test stuff!
3. Hardhat will then "deploy" your compiled contract to your local blockchain. That's that address you see at the end there. It's our deployed contract, on our mini version of Ethereum.
